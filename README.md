Functionality

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two player game that consists of alternating 'X's and 'O's until either player is able to connect three of their respective markers. Users are also able to customize their player names and select their markers if desired.

This project is a demonstration of my ability to utilize factory functions and module patterns as an upgrade to constructors. If not careful, constructors can introduce errors that are hard to trace. Moreover, factory functions and modules patterns utilize scope to protect private functions and names from being accessed elsewhere in the program; thus reducing pollution of global scope.

The biggest challenge in this project was implementing the 'Restart' function to clear not only the gameBoard array, but also the display markers on the browser. In the end, I learned how to use cloneNode() as a way to create new cells the replace the old ones.

Overall, this project was pretty straightforward and I am particularly happy about how my CSS colors and animations turned out. I will definitely be using factory functions and modules going forward as they make the code much cleaner.
